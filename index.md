## Research Interests

Amirali is a Research Associate at the <a href="https://cait.rutgers.edu/"> Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation</a> at Rutgers University. His research focuses on cyber-physical approaches for: <br><br>
(1) testing and simulation, such as hybrid simulation, for characterization of innovative and sustainable materials and structures, <br>
(2) autonomous damage assessment, by developing digital twins with structural health monitoring and artificial intelligence capabilities, and <br>
(3) developing infrastructure asset investment planning tools for management of existing and new assets that enable infrastructure authorities and municipalities to use monitoring data-driven insights to guide decision making and capital investment planning over the life of an asset. 

An illustration for cyber-physical testing and simulation is Amirali's dissertation research on <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2142/110408"> Multi-Axial Real-Time Hybrid Simulation</a>, which allows for characterization of structural systems subject to natural hazards, by only testing structural elements of interest and numerically simulating the rest of the structure. This method ensures that real-world complexities, such as dynamic and nonlinear behaviors, are incorporated into laboratory testing, while allowing for rapid deployment, testing flexibility, cost and space savings.
